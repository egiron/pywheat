Python library for simulation of wheat phenological development, crop growth and yield.

# Intro

The PyWheat simulates the wheat growth and development in a daily time-step. Most of the algorithms are based on the original routines of the CERES-Wheat 2.0[^1]. PyWheat model has also much in common with the N-Wheat model. Improvements of both models carried out in DSSAT 4.7.5.11 [^2] and APSIM-Wheat 7.5 R3008[^3] are included gradually in this beta version.

To accurately simulate wheat growth, development, and yield, the model takes into account the following processes:

* Phenological development, especially as it is affected by genetics and weather.
* Extension growth of leaves, stems, and roots.
* Biomass accumulation and partitioning, especially reproductive organs.
* Soil water balance and water use by the crop.
* Soil nitrogen transformations, uptake by the crop, and partitioning among plant parts. 


## Quick start

The package for estimating wheat grain yield using pywheat can be installed with `pip`:

``` sh
pip install pywheat
```
